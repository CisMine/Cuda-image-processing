Even with OpenCV in C++ using CUDA, it is still too slow. Therefore, in this repository, I will rewrite an OpenCV library to optimize image processing by using Cuda-C


This repository serves a dual purpose: it provides you with a high-performance image processing library that surpasses OpenCV in C++, while also offering an excellent learning resource for those interested in mastering CUDA-C and parallel image processing.


## How to use my code
In my codebase, you will find three source files. Each serves a distinct purpose:

- **OpenCV with CUDA Library:** This source file relies on the OpenCV library, enhanced with CUDA support.
  
- **My Parallel Implementation:** This source file contains a simplified implementation, ideal for those who want to learn about parallel image processing. It serves as an educational resource, illustrating the fundamentals of parallel programming techniques.

- **Optimized Without OpenCV:** The third source file is an optimized version tailored for users who prefer not to use OpenCV. It provides efficient image processing solutions without relying on the OpenCV library, giving you greater control and flexibility over the process.


## Requirements
- OpenCV C++ (with Cuda)
- Cuda

To check if you have CUDA installed, try running the following command:
 - nvcc -V
